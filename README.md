- Status: Open
- Proposer: Wow Labz

### **Overview** ðŸ“„

Dot Marketplace is a general purpose decentralised marketplace created as a Substrate pallet.  

The current scope of work involves two user types: **Customer** and **Service Provider (or Worker)**

- The Customer can post a task and invite bids from Service Providers to fulfill it. 
- The Customer needs to deposit the budgeted amount in an escrow for the task to be published. 
- The Service Provider needs to deposit some token to participate in a bid. If not shortlisted, this bid amount is returned. 
- The Service Provider completes the task and submits it. 
- The Customer accepts the work and the escrowed amount is credited to the Service Providers wallet.
- The Customer rates the Service Provider and visa versa.

NOTE: If the Customer doesn't accept the work, a dispute is raised and it gets resolved in a decentralised court (out of current scope) which will be implemented in the next phase. 

The following diagrams highlight the workflow:

Dot Marketplace is being built as a Substrate pallet. It would include boilerplate code that parachain teams can customize as per their own requirements. We believe this project has the potential to transform community participation, engagement and governance in decentralized projects.

The current focus is to enhance the existing Substrate pallet and allied code base to get a basic yet functional marketplace up and running:


### **Ecosystem Fit**

Dot Marketplace can be used by any decentralised project to float tasks and invite their community members to execute them for a reward. Its MVP was developed during the Polkadot India buildathon (2021).  

The inspiration for Dot Marketplace emerged from our own needs while building Yoda - a protocol that facilitates decentralised app development leveraging open data. Dot Marketplace would be used to create data, services and app marketplaces on Yoda, which would motivate us to maintain this project in the long run.

### **Team&#39;s experience**

Dot Marketplace is being built by the team at Wow Labz.
Wow Labz is one of India&#39;s leading turnkey product development companies.
Yoda Protocol has been conceptualised and is being built by the team at Wow Labz. The team has previously built a decentralised storage protocol called Lake Network - [https://lakenetwork.io/](https://lakenetwork.io/) in addition to multiple dApps on Ethereum, Stellar, EOS and Hyperledger.

## **Development Roadmap**ðŸ”©

The development of Dot Marketplace is already underway. 
For the custom pallet (tasking) we have: 
1. Used various Substrate provided traits like - `Currency`, `ExistenceRequirement`, `LockIdentifier`, `LockableCurrency`, `ReservableCurrency` and few more;
2. Used the pre-existing pallets like `assets`, `balances` and `staking`;
3. Implemented custom structs like `TaskDetails` and `TransferDetails`. These in return are used for various functionalities like `create_task`, `bid_task`, `complete_task` and `approve_task`. A special transfer money function is only initiated once the task cycle gets completed and the escrow funds are released to the worker. 



### **Future Plans** 
Future releases of the Dot Marketplace include:

| Phase        | Deliverable   | Specification  |
| :-------------|:-------------:| :--------------|
| 2      | Decentralised Court | A fully decentralised dispute resolution mechanism along with configurible rules for slashing and reputation.          |
| 3      | Milestone based submissions | Making provisions to breakdown a project into multiple configurable milestones to allow parallel or sequential execution        |
| 4     | Decentralised Storage | Integration with IPFS or another decentralised storage platform        |
